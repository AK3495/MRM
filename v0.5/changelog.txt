v0.5
===================================================
- Fixed a bug where using spm_select lead to the data selector indicating that a NifTi file was not NifTi
- Fixed an issue with calculating the ranks of SSCPH and SSCPE that could lead to an underestimation in certain slices (lead to ‘striping’ in the refF images)
- Fixed a bug where the input box for the mask would disappear if the user pressed cancel
